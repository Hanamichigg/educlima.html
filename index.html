        <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
        <p>Human activities are causing world temperatures to rise, with more intense heatwaves and rising sea-levels among the consequences.</p>
        <p>TThings are likely to worsen in the coming decades, but scientists argue urgent action can limit the worst effects of climate change.</p>
        <p>Climate is sometimes mistaken for weather. But climate is different from weather because it is measured over a long period of time, whereas weather can change from day to day, or from year to year. The climate of an area includes seasonal temperature
            and rainfall averages, and wind patterns. Different places have different climates. A desert, for example, is referred to as an arid climate because little water falls, as rain or snow, during the year. Other types of climate include tropical
            climates, which are hot and humid, and temperate climates, which have warm summers and cooler winters.</p>
        <p>Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local, regional, and global climates. It is primarily driven by human activities, leading to an increase in global temperatures and widespread
            environmental impacts.</p>
        <p>The Earth's climate is influenced by various factors, including greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and industrial activities. The resulting changes contribute to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems.</p>
        <p>In polar regions, the warming global temperatures associated with climate change have meant ice sheets and glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate from season to season. This contributes to sea levels rising in different regions of the planet.
            Together with expanding ocean waters due to rising temperatures, the resulting rise in sea level has begun to damage coastlines as a result of increased flooding and erosion.</p>
        <p>The cause of current climate change is largely human activity, like burning fossil fuels, like natural gas, oil, and coal. Burning these materials releases what are called greenhouse gases into Earth’s atmosphere. There, these gases trap heat
            from the sun’s rays inside the atmosphere causing Earth’s average temperature to rise. This rise in the planet's temperature is called global warming. The warming of the planet impacts local and regional climates. Throughout Earth's history,
            climate has continually changed. When occuring naturally, this is a slow process that has taken place over hundreds and thousands of years. The human influenced climate change that is happening now is occuring at a much faster rate.</p>

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Climate change is primarily driven by human activities that contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Some key causes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Burning of Fossil Fuels:</b> The combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere.</li>
            <li><b>Deforestation:</b> Clearing large areas of forests reduces the number of trees available to absorb CO2, contributing to increased greenhouse gas levels.</li>
            <li><b>Industrial Processes:</b> Certain industrial activities release potent greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide.</li>
            <li><b>Agriculture:</b> Agricultural practices, such as livestock farming and rice cultivation, produce methane emissions.</li>
            <li><b>Generating power:</b> Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still produced from fossil fuels; only about a quarter comes from
                wind, solar and other renewable sources.</li>
            <li><b>Manufacturing goods:</b> Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes and other goods. Mining and other industrial
                processes also release gases.</li>
            <li><b>Using transportation:</b> Most cars, lorries, ships and planes run on fossil fuels. That makes transportation a major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially carbon-dioxide emissions. Road vehicles account for the largest part, but
                emissions from ships and planes continue to grow.</li>
            <li><b>Powering buildings:</b> Globally, residential and commercial buildings consume over half of all electricity. As they continue to draw on coal, oil and natural gas for heating and cooling, they emit significant quantities of greenhouse gas
                emissions.
            </li>
            <li><b>Consuming too much:</b> Your home and use of power, how you move around, what you eat and how much you throw away all contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. So does the consumption of goods such as clothing, electronics and plastics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding these causes is crucial for implementing effective strategies to mitigate climate change.

    <section id="effects">
        <h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Climate change has far-reaching effects on the environment, ecosystems, and human societies. Some notable consequences include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Increased drought:</b> Water is becoming scarcer in more regions. Droughts can stir destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food. Many people
                now face the threat of not having enough water on a regular basis.</li>
            <li><b>More severe storms:</b> Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 2020 was one of the hottest years on record. Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and can make it more difficult to work and move around.
                Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter.</li>
            <li><b>Rising Sea Levels:</b> Melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to sea level rise, threatening coastal communities and ecosystems.</li>
            <li><b>Extreme Weather Events:</b> Changes in climate patterns lead to more frequent and severe events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves.</li>
            <li><b>Loss of Biodiversity:</b> Disruptions to ecosystems and habitats result in the decline of plant and animal species.</li>
            <li><b>Changes in Water Resources:</b> Altered precipitation patterns affect water availability, leading to droughts or floods in various regions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human
            activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions,
            we may avoid some of the worst effects.</p>
        <p>Understanding the effects of climate change is essential for adapting to its impacts and building resilience.</p>

        <h3>"The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet. Any further delay in concerted global action will miss the brief, rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future."</h3>

        <h2>Impacts on Wildlife</h2>
        <p>Humans and wild animals face new challenges for survival because of climate change. More frequent and intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans can directly harm animals, destroy the places they
            live, and wreak havoc on people's livelihoods and communities.</p>
        <p>Here are some negative effects of climate change on wildlife:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Loss of Habitats:</b> Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can lead to the loss or alteration of habitats, affecting the availability of food and shelter for wildlife.</li>
            <li><b>Shifts in Migration Patterns:</b> Climate change can alter the timing and routes of animal migrations, affecting their ability to find suitable breeding and feeding grounds.</li>
            <li><b>Extinction Risks:</b> Species that are unable to adapt quickly enough to changing conditions face an increased risk of extinction.</li>
            <li><b>Disruption of Food Chains:</b> Changes in climate can affect the abundance and distribution of prey and predators, leading to imbalances in ecosystems.</li>
            <li><b>Human-wildlife Conflict:</b> Climate change intensifies human-wildlife conflict through habitat loss and extreme climate events, forcing people and wildlife to share increasingly crowded spaces. As ecosystems change, people and wildlife
                roam farther in search of food, water and resources. Human-wildlife conflict often results in devastating impact for the animals affected. </li>
            <li><b>Animal Health:</b> As changes in weather and temperature alter geographic regions, wildlife may seek out agreeable habitats. This means that invasive species suited to changes in extreme climate may get a foothold in an ecosystem where
                at-risk native species are unable to hold their place. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>People can help stop the impacts of climate change on wildlife by supporting policies that encourage a diversity of species and donating toward wildlife recovery. Donations made to Defenders support our legal work fighting for wildlife as well as the numerous community projects implemented by field experts that support coexistence work.  </b></p>
